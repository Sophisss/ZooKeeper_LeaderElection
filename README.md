# ZooKeeper_LeaderElection
A simple distributed system that implements a **leader election algorithm** using [Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) and [Kazoo](https://kazoo.readthedocs.io/) in Python.

This project demonstrates how processes can coordinate automatically to elect a leader and handle failover using **ephemeral sequential znodes** and **watchers**.

## Technologies
| Tool               | Description                             |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Apache ZooKeeper   | Distributed coordination service        |
| Python 3.8+        | Programming language                    |
| Kazoo              | High-level ZooKeeper client for Python  |
| Docker             | Containerization platform               |
| Logging (Python)   | For process tracing and debugging       |

## Quick Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sophisss/ZooKeeper_LeaderElection.git
cd ZooKeeper_LeaderElection
```

### 2. Run ZooKeeper with Docker
```bash
docker run -d --name zookeeper -p 2181:2181 zookeeper
```

ZooKeeper will be running at `127.0.0.1:2181`.

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install kazoo
```


## How It Works
This project simulates a distributed environment where multiple processes compete to become the leader using ZooKeeper.

The logic is based on ZooKeeper's ephemeral sequential znodes and the watch mechanism. Here is how it works:

1. Each process connects to the ZooKeeper server.
2. It creates an **ephemeral sequential znode** under the path `/election`.
   - Example: `/election/node_0000000003`
3. ZooKeeper automatically assigns a sequence number to each node.
4. All znodes in `/election` are listed and sorted by sequence number.
5. The process whose znode has the **lowest number** becomes the **leader**.
6. Other processes become **followers** and set a **watch** on the znode immediately before theirs.
7. If the watched znode is deleted (the predecessor crashes or disconnects), the follower is notified and re-evaluates its position.
8. The next in line becomes the new leader.

> This simple algorithm guarantees that at any time, there is exactly one leader, and a new one can be elected without restarting the system.


## Running the Application
To simulate a distributed system, open **multiple terminal** and run the application in each one.

Each process will:
- Connect to the ZooKeeper server.
- Create its own ephemeral sequential znode.
- Determine if it's the leader or a follower.
- React to failures by participating in automatic re-election.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run in terminal
```bash
python zookeeper_election.py
```
